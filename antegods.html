							Antegods is an action-packed arena game in which the remnants of the Mayan civilization have taken to space. Two teams of 4 players each control customizable stonepunk mechs to hunt for energy and fight off opponents in a procedurally generated and highly destructible map. This game is still in development.

						<h2>Details </h2>	
						<p>
						I am the Lead Programmer on this project, and designed the gameplay & network code architecture. It uses a peer 2 peer system with a custom reliability layer on top of UDP. The middle ware is easy to port to other platforms and has been used internally for other projects.</p>
						<p>Antegods also features a mesh slicer that can slice the level blocks, and create cached destroyed versions of the level blocks, allowing for fast performing and good looking destruction.</p>
						<p>
						One of the gameplay systems that I designed and implemented was a modular weapon & ability system, allowing the game designer to tweak & create new weapons with little effort. The game also supports a procedural generation of the levels, based on the same principle as Spelunky.</p>
						<p>Together with the Lead Artist we created a workflow that allows easy changing of the ingame skins of the character and destruction models.</p>
