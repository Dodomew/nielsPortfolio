							Last Inua is an immersive and emotional platform adventure game developed by Glowforth. A captivating experience, Last Inua tells the tale of an Inuit familyâ€™s fight for survival in the harsh elements of the mythical Arctic. The Tonrar, a demonic trickster, has awoken in the arctic.

						<h2>Details </h2>	
						<p>
						I was asked by Glowforth to help build a prototype. The initial version of the game was going to be done in C++ in an custom engine I would build. This was also the first time I interviewed an intern and guided him through the internship.</p>
						<p>I created a custom engine using OpenGl and implemented Box2D physics. I also created a shape editor for the game designers to build various objects with it. Those objects could then be placed in the level editor that the intern under my supervision created.</p>
						<p>With this prototype created, Glowforth realized that they needed a more designer friendly engine and switched to Unity. I helped them recreate the initial prototype.</p>
