						<h2>Details </h2>	
						<p>
						For the mobile version I was the Lead Programmer on this project, and lead a team of 7 programmers to update our internal engine to also support OpenGL ES 2, next to D3D11. A major task for Terraria was to optimize its memory usage, as our target device only left 100MB for running apps. I designed and implemented a memory streaming technique that was fast and made most use of the memory. </p>
						<p>Another large task was to setup and maintain the build pipeline, we created several scripts to automate the building as much as possible for all 4 target platforms. This allowed us to release many updates over the years and improve the game.</p>
						<p>The 3DS version was developed at a later stage, and continued from the work that was done on the mobile version of the game. The 3DS had an even lower target memory restriction and I helped optimizing it as much was possible. The 3DS had also framerate issues in some area's of the game, which I also helped optimizing.</p>
						<p>For the PS3 version of the game I helped implementing a part of the platform integration and fixing TRC's.</p>
